# Profanity-Detector
# AUTHOR: NANTHINI
Brief : A system that detects profane words in a document that is uploaded. There is a list of bad words stored in the file called 'bad.txt'. You can edit this to add whatever words you want to detect. Once you are done with this, run the Python program Profanity.py on shell and specify the name(or path) of the file you want to detect for profane words.

Possible extension: Further we can suggest some word replacements for the bad wrods detected enabling an easier way to edit the documents.
